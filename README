mesgd - an all purpose swissarmy chainsaw
----------------------------------------

The primary goal of mesgd is to be the world's best server for connecting applications together.

Getting Started
===============

To get started, you'll need beamer, https://github.com/cthulhuology/beamer.git 
It is a tool that I use to make my life in Erlang a little less painful (cause rebar3 and mix suck)
Once you have it installed, you can type:

	make

And beamer will checkout all the dependencies in the "deps" file, and will install the beams
in your $HOME/.beamer directory. From there everything is just kinda automatic for the people.

	./mesgd 

To run.
