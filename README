Orc Server
==========

This repository contains the Open Robotics Company Messaging Server.

This is a general purpose Secure WebSocket server which supports,
[json](http://json.org), [ujson](http://ujson.org), and binary 
messages.  We use it as a LAN messaging hub for routing different
subsets of device data stream to various processing engines. This
server makes use of content based filtering that allows you to route
messages based on the contents of the message payload.  We have
found that content based routing gives us the greatest degree of
flexibility in terms of defining a runtime messaging topology with 
a minimal amount of configuration. 


Getting Started
---------------

In the priv directory of the repo you will need to install:

	cacert.pem	-- the cert for you CA
	cert.pem	-- the signed cert for your server
	key.pem		-- the private key you sign the CSR with

You can use public certs such as those provided by letsencrypt, or
as we recommend using your own self-signed certs managed by your own
CA.  (We will be releasing code for running an ORC style CA of your 
own in another project).

Once you have the code installed on each of your nodes,
start your nodes on your lan:
	
	orc node1@localhost node &
	orc node2@localhost node &

You can then initialize the database:

	orc node1@localhost init node1@localhost node2@localhost

Then start the servers of your cluster;

	orc node1@localhost start 4433 node1@localhost node2@localhost
	orc node2@localhost start 4434 node1@localhost node2@localhost

This will start a two server cluster running on port 4433 4434


You can get more help with:

	orc help


Setting Up Users
----------------

Before you can create a data stream, you will need to provision a
user for your stream:

	orc user add username email password
	orc user grant username path

The path can be something as simple as "/*" which will allow the
user to access all data in the stream, or can limit it to messages
with only specific attributes.

For example, a path of:

	/device=123/to=dave/*

Will limit the user to only those messages which have the form:

	{ "device": "123", "to": "dave", ... }

The user is free to add further restrictions such as:

	/device=123/to=dave/loc=nyc

Requesting only messages like:

	{ "device": "123", "to": "dave", "loc": "nyc", ... }

But they will not have permissions to access messages that have 
fewer restrictions.


Connecting to the Server
------------------------

Assuming you install your CA cert in your browser of choice, you can
access the server via JavaScript using the WebSocket object:

	var ws = new WebSocket("wss://username:password@myserver.local:4433/device=123/to=dave","json");

Note well the use of the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header.  The valid
values for supported protocols are json and ujson currently.  For feeds 
which require no filtering, leaving the protocol blank will forward
the raw messages.

This example URL assumes you have signed the cert for a server 'myserver.local'
and have provisioned a user of "username" with password "password".  The messages
you will receive will be formatted in json (regardless if their origin was json, ujson,
or another supported format).
